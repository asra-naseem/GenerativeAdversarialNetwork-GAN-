# Dataset augmentation GenerativeAdversarialNetwork-GAN-
DATASET Augmentation using GenerativeAdversarialNetworks(GANS)

The primary objective that will be focussed on in this project is increasing the size of
the data set. Many techniques have been developed to combat overfitting ( plotting an
exact curve along the given data which will not produce correct results during the
testing phase ), these include, batch normalization, layer, etc. Nevertheless, when the
data is not significant in size, the feature and parameter learning wonâ€™t proceed the way
it needs to. The parameters will be underdetermined, and the network will generalize
poorly. In many cases, while procuring the data, numerous numbers of samples are no
available due to a various number of reasons, say, non-availability, ease-of-reach, etc.
To combat the above, the data available should be put to more use by augmenting it
with precise data. This can be achieved with Generative Adversarial Network model
which takes care of the larger invariance space rather than restricting to the available
classes.
